Please follow the instructions below to setup a calendar on your page:
============================================
1. To install, simply extract the zip package to any directory on your hard drive, say c:\calendar.
2. The fastest way to test is to using your browser to open the c:\calendar\demos.htm, where you may find many live examples.
3. To get to know the insight, please open the c:\calendar\tutorials.htm in any browser, and
	1) Read "HelloWorld - the beginner's guide" tutorial carefully for how to use the calendar tags on your page.
	2) Read "Working with themes" tutorial for how to choose and setup a theme for the calendar, as well as how to customize theme options like date range and color.
	3) Read "Setting up agendas & holidays" if you want to have events shown on the calendar or get events from a backend DB.
	4) Read other tutorials for localization, internationalization and making your own plugins.
4. If you have any question, please read the FAQ.htm first. Tons of helpful tips can be found inside it.


Necessary files involved in an installation:
===========================
ipopeng.htm (npopeng.htm)		-- these are so-called engine files (npopeng.htm is for Netscape 4.x only)
"theme-name".js & "theme-name".css	-- theme files, e.g. mini.js & mini.css (for "mini" theme)
plugins.js				-- plugins file that MUST exist. It could be empty if nothing needs to be plugged in.
agenda.js				-- events & holiday definition file. It could be empty, but you should have it there unless it's not defined in the name & id of the calendar tag.
