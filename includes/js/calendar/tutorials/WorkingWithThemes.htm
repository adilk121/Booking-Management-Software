  <h3>Working with themes</h3>
  <p>One of the most powerful feature of CalendarXP is the theme support. Themes 
    are like clothes of the calendar and can be switched back and forth to create 
    different looks in seconds. In addition to using the bundled high quality 
    themes you may also customize your own to perfectly match the tone of your 
    web page.</p>
  <h4>What's in a theme?</h4>
  <p>A theme defines all the customizable options that control the look&amp;feel 
    of the calendar, like colors, fonts, sizes and layout. A theme usually consists 
    of 5 parts - don't be scared, it's actually quite simple to deal with them.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>theme-name.js</strong> file has all kinds of advanced options 
      defined in javascript, most of them are static options. </li>
    <li> <strong>theme-name.css</strong> file is the CSS file used to render the 
      fonts, border and other CSS styles. </li>
    <li> <strong>calendar tag</strong> consists of one or more iframe/layer tags 
      that build up the calendar body, as detailed in the HelloWorld tutorial. 
    </li>
    <li> <strong>plugins.js</strong> file defines all dynamic functions that extend 
      the calendar behaviors, e.g. the artificial dropdowns in &quot;fancy&quot; 
      theme. It's detailed in the <a href="PluginsSDK.htm">PluginsSDK tutorial</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>graphic files</strong> used in the theme, like button images and 
      so on.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As a simplest example the &quot;normal&quot; theme has a normal.js, a normal.css, a plugins.js and a simple calendar tag.</p>
  <p><strong>We always suggest you put all calendar related files into a separate directory and set the src of the calendar tags to reference them. This makes them more like a self-contained component and is easy for you to maintain in future.</strong><br>
  </p>
  <h4>Implementing/Install a calendar with the specific theme</h4>
  <p>Usually you'll need to follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Opt a theme that you want to use, suppose it's the &quot;outlook&quot; 
      theme.</li>
    <li>Copy the calendar engine files from the <code>engines</code> directory to the <code>themes/outlook</code> directory.</li>
    <li>Copy the <code>agenda.js</code> file from the HelloWorld demo directory to the <code>themes/outlook</code> directory.</li>
    <li>Open the <code>xxxTemplate.htm</code> in your browser to see how the theme looks like. </li>
    <li>Pick up the calendar tags from the <code>xxxTemplate.htm</code> and integrate into your own page.</li>
    <li>Modify the <code>src</code> property of the calendar tag on your page to have <code>themes/outlook</code> in the path. You don't need to change anything if your page is also located in the <code>themes/outlook</code> directory.</li>
    <li>If you decide to put the theme files in a separate location, you'll have to specify the absolute web path in 
    the name &amp; id of the calendar tag.</li>
    <li>Setup the <code>gfPop.fPopCalendar()</code> function in the onclick events 
      of HTML tags so that it can be triggered. </li>
</ol>
 
  <p><em><span class="style1">Note</span>: The location of the theme files is relative to the location of the engine 
    file, it's NOT relative to the web page containing the calendar. Therefore you'd 
    better use the absolute path  to avoid confusion if the theme files are located in a different dir. A good sample could be:</em></p>

  <blockquote>

    <div class="dottedBox"> 
      <p><code>&lt;IFRAME width=102 height=100 name=&quot;gToday:/cal/themes/supermini:/cal/agenda/agenda.js&quot; 
          id=&quot;gToday:/cal/themes/supermini:/cal/agenda/agenda.js&quot; src=&quot;ipopeng.htm&quot; 
          scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;visibility:visible; 
          z-index:999; position:absolute; top:-500px; left:-500px;&quot;&gt;<br>
          &lt;LAYER name=&quot;gToday:/cal/themes/supermini:/cal/agenda/agenda.js&quot; src=&quot;npopeng.htm&quot; background=&quot;npopeng.htm&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/LAYER&gt;<br>
          &lt;/IFRAME&gt;</code></p>
    </div>

</blockquote>
<p><em><span class="style1">Note</span>:</em> <em>If you don't want any agenda or holiday, you may skip step 3. However, you MUST also remove the agenda.js parameter from the name &amp; id of the calendar tag. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Switching among different themes</h4>
  <p>It's quite easy to change the look of the calendar. In most cases, you just need to 
    change the &quot;theme-name&quot; in the name &amp; id properties and copy 
    the relevant files over. 
    Please check out the HelloWorld tutorial for examples. e.g. change the above calendar sample from supermini theme to normal theme with no agenda file:<em></em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <div class="dottedBox">
      <p><code>&lt;IFRAME width=102 height=100 name=&quot;gToday:/cal/themes/normal&quot; id=&quot;gToday:/cal/themes/normal&quot; src=&quot;ipopeng.htm&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;visibility:visible; z-index:999; position:absolute; top:-500px; left:-500px;&quot;&gt;<br>
&lt;LAYER name=&quot;gToday:/cal/themes/normal&quot; src=&quot;npopeng.htm&quot; background=&quot;npopeng.htm&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/LAYER&gt;<br>
&lt;/IFRAME&gt;</code></p>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Customizing your own theme</h4>
  <p>Although quite a few high quality themes have been provided with the release 
    package, they wouldn't cover everybody's favor. So let's brief on how to customize 
    it now.</p>
  <p>A calendar comprises 3 sections - top, middle and bottom. They are actually 
    3 table cells in one vertical column. </p>

<ul>
  <li> 
    The top section is usually stuffed with navigation controls 
      (prev, next arrow/button) and month/year selectors. It's optional.
  </li>
  <li>The middle section is the main calendar body, containing all calendar cells.</li>
  <li>The bottom section can be used for showing today or whatever you like. It's 
    also optional.</li>
</ul>

  <p>We have a diagram here illustrating most CSS used in the <code>theme-name.css</code> 
    file, as following:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="calDiagram.gif" width="535" height="352" border="0"></p>
  <p>The <code>theme-name.js</code> file is another major option store. There 
    are more than 60 options in it. The file is self-documented and you may go 
    through and play with it simply using the Notepad. We only state several important 
    ones here:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <strong>gsSplit</strong> is the separator of date string. If set it to empty string, then giMonthMode and gbPadZero will be fixed to 0 and true.</li>
  <li><strong>giDatePos</strong> determines the date format sequence 0: D-M-Y 
    ; 1: M-D-Y; 2: Y-M-D</li>
  <li><strong>gbPadZero</strong> decides whether to pad the digits with 0 in the 
    left when less than 10.</li>
  <li><strong>giMonthMode</strong> is the month format. 0: digits ; 1: full name 
    from gMonths; &gt;=2: abbreviated month name in specified length.</li>
  <li><strong>gbShortYear</strong> is the year format. true: 2-digits; false: 
    4-digits</li>
  <li><strong>gbAutoPos</strong> decides whether to enable auto-adpative positioning 
    or not.</li>
  <li> <strong>gbPopDown</strong> if set to true: pop the calendar below the dateCtrl; 
    if false: pop above as long as gbAutoPos is false.</li>
  <li> <strong>gbAutoClose</strong> decides whether to close the calendar after 
    selecting a date.</li>
  <li> <strong>gPosOffset</strong> is used as offsets to adjust the pop-up postion, 
    in format [leftOffset, topOffset].</li>
  <li> <strong>gbFixedPos</strong> when set to true: pop the calendar absolutely 
    at gPosOffset; when false: use gPosOffset as relative offsets to the localizer.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
  <p>Other common options are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>gAgendaMask</strong> sets a pattern that will mask out the irrelevant 
      agenda properties in order to give the theme a uniform look, especially 
      userful when sharing agendas across calendars with different themes.</li>
    <li> <strong>gBegin, gEnd</strong> are to set the date range of the calendar. 
      e.g. The following settings will disable all past dates and dates after 
      Dec 10, 2020.<br>
      <div class="dottedBox"><code>var gBegin=gToday;<br>
        var gEnd=[2020,12,10];</code></div>
    </li>
    <li><strong>giFirstDOW</strong> sets the calendar to start on different weekday. e.g. 0 will 
	make Sunday the first day, while 1 will make Monday the first day.</li>
    <li><strong>giCellWidth, giCellHeight</strong> defines the width and height 
      of a calendar cell. Note you are also required to adjust the font size in order to 
      make a tiny calendar.</li>
    <li><strong>gbHideTop, gbHideBottom</strong> control the appearance of top 
      and bottom sections.</li>
    <li><strong>giDCStyle</strong> sets the top section to 3 predefined layouts. 
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>giDCStyle=0</strong>, the engine will create 2 HTML &lt;select&gt; 
          tags as the month/year selector, and use the HTML code in <code>gsNavPrev/gsNavNext</code> 
          to create the month navigators. </li>
        <li><strong>giDCStyle=1</strong>, the engine will create the center part 
          with <code>gsCalTitle</code>, and use the HTML code in <code>gsNavPrev/gsNavNext</code> 
          to create the month navigators.</li>
        <li><strong>giDCStyle=2</strong>, the engine will create the whole top 
          section with <code>gsCalTitle</code> only.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>gdSelect</strong> sets the selected date.</li>
    <li><strong>gbShrink2fit</strong> sets whether to remove the bottom week line 
      if all days in it belong to next month.</li>
    <li><strong>gcSat, gcSatBG, gcSun, gcSunBG</strong> set the font and background 
      colors of Saturday and Sunday.</li>
    <li><strong>giShowOther</strong> controls whether to show the days/agendas 
      in previous and next month sections.</li>
    <li><strong>giMarkToday, giMarkSelected</strong> set the display of today's 
      date and the selected date in more than 10 different effects.</li>
    <li><strong>gbShareAgenda</strong> determines whether to create a global agenda 
      store and connect the local instance to it so that all calendars on the 
      same page can share the same agenda store. It works with the agenda parameter 
      detailed in the <a href="SetupAgendas.htm">Setup Agendas &amp; Holidays 
      tutorial</a>.</li>
  </ul>
<p><br>
  <span class="style3">Note</span><em>: </em></p>
  <ol>
    <li><em>most of the font color (fgcolor) options in the theme-name.js file can be set to &quot;&quot;(empty string) - which has a special effect of making the fonts invisible and disabling any action of that date. </em></li>
    <li><em>the border of the calendar cell is not implemented in CSS, instead, it's controlled via the box effect, bgcolor and the cellpadding of the gsInnerTable option in the theme. This is to achieve cross-browser effect even on the older browsers like NN4. We have a FAQ on how to customize the border size. </em></li>
