  <h3>PopCalendar eXtremely Perfect</h3>

    picker available. There are very few, if any, things that other JavaScript
    date pickers can do that PopCalendarXP can not. Simply put with a cliche,
    it lets you get far more done in far less time. And the way we name it XP not only because it's perfect, but also because
    it's designed to be extremely perfect.</p>
